description: Produce today's relationship brief — 3 buckets (new business / relationship building / network expansion), 3 options each, with recommended channel, time estimate, and copy-ready draft per option. Drafts only — never sends. Respects time-budget filtering and tier-based cadence rules. Reads from cortex person pages, CRM, calendar, inbox; delegates to contact-researcher and pipeline-analyst when installed.

# /relationships

The daily relationship cockpit. Run in the morning (or anytime) to see who matters today, what to say, and how to spend the next 5/15/30/60+ minutes on relationship work.

---

## Step 0 — Preflight

Read `<config-root>/plugins/relationships.user-context.md`. If missing → route to `/setup-relationships` and stop.

Extract:
- Identity (name, first-name form, company, one-line description)
- Business context (primary/secondary ICP, out-of-ICP, current quarter focus, quarterly outcome target)
- Tiers (sizes + cadences) + close-personal track config
- Buckets (weights + hide-empty toggle)
- Voices (each named voice with descriptors, banned phrases, length, sign-off)
- Time budget defaults (typical availability + highly-variable toggle)
- CRM config (tool, owner, stages, tier-property, ICP-fit property, do-not-engage)
- Apollo config (enabled? daily/weekly cap)
- Companion plugins available

Also read (best-effort, skip silently if missing):
- `<config-root>/identity.md`, `<config-root>/voice.md`
- `<config-root>/memory/hot.md` (cortex hot cache — recent context)
- `<config-root>/memory/DASHBOARD.md` (cortex dashboard — active threads, P0s)

---

## Step 1 — Time-budget gate

If user-context has `highly_variable: true`, prompt:

> "How much time do you have today for relationship work? (5 / 15 / 30 / 60+ min)"

Otherwise use the typical default from user-context.

Save the chosen budget — it drives downstream re-ranking. The brief will still show 3 options per bucket, but each option is annotated with its time estimate, and the top-of-brief summary shows "Best fit for your X min" recommendations.

---

## Step 2 — Score and rank candidates

Three buckets. For each, score eligible candidates using the formula in `references/scoring.md`. High-level:

```
score = w_decay × decay_factor
      + w_trigger × trigger_factor
      + w_icp × icp_factor
      + w_reciprocity × reciprocity_factor
      + w_goal × goal_alignment_factor
      − w_penalty × cooling_penalty
```

Weights come from `references/scoring.md` defaults, modulated by the bucket weights in user-context.

### Bucket A — New Business Development

Candidate pool:
- Cortex person pages with `buckets` including `new_biz`
- CRM contacts associated with open deals (read-only)
- Apollo net-new prospects (if Apollo enabled and the weekly cap hasn't been hit; cap from user-context)
- Optional: contacts tagged ICP-fit `primary` or `secondary` in CRM but not in cortex yet

**If `pipeline-analyst` (core-ops) is installed:** delegate the ranking via Task tool with `subagent_type="pipeline-analyst"`. Pass the user-context path, 90d time window, focus filter "active deals + tier-A overdue + ICP-fit candidates," and `top-n=10` (we only show 3, but get a deeper list to filter).

Apply scoring. Keep the top candidates.

### Bucket B — Relationship Building

Candidate pool:
- Cortex person pages with `buckets` including `relationship`
- Default `tier: inner` or `tier: strategic` people whose `next_touch_target` has passed
- People with WAITING:you open loops on their person page
- If close-personal track is enabled: people with `relationship_class: personal` and overdue cadence (separate sub-bucket)

**If `referral-engine` is installed:** delegate warm-network ask candidates via its scoring rules (cooling periods, positive-moment triggers, fiscal-year triggers) for any tier-strategic+ people.

Apply scoring. Keep top.

### Bucket C — Network Expansion

Candidate pool (three types — surface a mix):
- **Engagement actions** — LinkedIn comment opportunities on contacts' recent posts (signals from `lead-engine` if installed), pipeline of "people whose content you actively engage with" from user-context
- **Content posting prompts** — for each named voice, a topic suggestion drawn from cortex recent insights, DECISION entries, or workstream activity. Match topic to voice's surface (e.g., business voice → operational AI on the BrightWay page; personal voice → broader AI thought leadership)
- **Events / conferences / meetups** — Phase 1 surfaces manual entries from user-context only. Phase 5 will add Eventbrite/Luma/Meetup APIs and AI web search.

Apply scoring. Keep top.

---

## Step 3 — Filter and select 3 per bucket

For each bucket's top candidates, apply hard filters:

- **Cooling period:** if a contact was touched within the tier's minimum-gap window, skip.
- **Do-not-engage:** if CRM marks them DNE, skip.
- **Active-deal sensitivity:** if a contact is mid-active-deal and the next-step is theirs (WAITING:them with a recent commitment from them), skip from new-biz bucket; possibly surface in relationship bucket as a soft touch.
- **"Should we even send?" filter** (ported from `bizdev-outreach`):
  - Is the ball in their court?
  - Did your last message set a tone follow-up would undermine?
  - Is there genuine new value?
  - Too soon based on their bandwidth signals?

Keep the top 3 per bucket post-filter.

If a bucket has < 3 candidates:
- If user-context `hide_empty_buckets: true` → hide the bucket
- Otherwise → show what's available + a "no urgent actions in this bucket — quietly carrying X overdue Operational contacts" footnote

---

## Step 4 — Pick channel + template + draft

For each of the (up to) 9 surfaced cards:

### Channel selection

A simple rule table (full table in `references/scoring.md`):

| Relationship class | Tier | Trigger | Recommended channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Business | New (no prior contact) | ICP fit | LinkedIn DM cold OR email cold |
| Business | New | Warm intro available | Email intro request |
| Business | Inner / Strategic | Cadence overdue | Email or LinkedIn DM (their preferred channel from cortex page) |
| Business | Inner / Strategic | They posted | LinkedIn comment on the post |
| Business | Any | Job change / news | LinkedIn DM congrats (5-min touch) |
| Personal | Any | Cadence overdue | Text or Instagram DM |
| Personal | Any | Big news | Phone call |
| Network | — | Content opportunity | Self-post (in the named voice) |
| Network | — | Conference | Pre-event DM to attendees the user knows |

User-context can override per relationship_class.

### Template selection

Map (relationship_class, tier, trigger, channel) → template at `references/templates/<channel>/<scenario>.md`. If user has custom overrides at `<config-root>/relationships/templates/<channel>/<scenario>.md`, prefer those.

### Variable filling

Common variables:
- `{{person.first_name}}`, `{{person.full_name}}`, `{{person.title}}`, `{{person.company}}`
- `{{trigger.context}}` — short string describing why now (e.g., "$12M Series B last week")
- `{{trigger.specific}}` — a more specific reference (e.g., "your post about content velocity")
- `{{user.first_name}}`, `{{user.company}}`, `{{user.one_liner}}`
- `{{shared_context}}` — last-meaningful-contact context from cortex person page (if present)
- `{{voice.signoff}}` — pulled from the voice block being used

If a required variable can't be filled (e.g., no shared context for a cold prospect), pick a template variant that doesn't need it OR mark the card as "draft incomplete — needs your touch" and surface what's missing.

### Voice routing

For Network Expansion content-posting prompts, route to the voice block named in the user-context for that surface (e.g., business voice on the BrightWay page). For all other channels, use the user's primary voice unless `relationship_class: personal` (in which case use the personal voice if defined).

### Time estimate

Each card carries an estimated time-to-execute:
- LinkedIn comment: 2-3 min
- LinkedIn / Instagram DM: 3-5 min
- Text: 1-2 min
- Email cold: 5-8 min
- Email warm: 3-5 min
- Phone call: 10-15 min
- Self-post (with template): 10-15 min draft + review
- Conference DM: 3-5 min

Annotate per card.

---

## Step 5 — Present the brief

Format for fast scanning. Mobile-readable line lengths. This is operational, not a report.

```
GOOD MORNING, [first_name]                    Today's budget: [X] min

  ⚡ Best fits for [X] min (across all buckets):
     • [Bucket] — [Person/topic]  (~Y min)
     • [Bucket] — [Person/topic]  (~Y min)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  (3 options)

1. [Person] · [Title], [Company]
   WHY NOW   [trigger context]
   CHANNEL   [recommended channel]
   TIME      ~[Y] min

   [Drafted message body — copy ready]

   [ Copy ] [ Open in Claude ] [ Skip ] [ Snooze 7d ]

2. ...
3. ...

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING  (3 options) — biz / personal split if both apply

[same per-card format]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NETWORK EXPANSION  (3 options)

[same per-card format]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUIETLY CARRYING
  [N] Operational contacts overdue; [M] Strategic contacts in cooling.
  Run /network-rebalance quarterly to triage.
```

After presenting, ask: "Want me to draft any deeper, mark anything done, or move on?"

---

## Step 6 — Write the artifact files

After presenting, write the brief in two formats:

### `<config-root>/relationships/today.md`

Markdown snapshot for audit trail and downstream readers (Obsidian, daily-brief integration, the user via grep). Filename `<config-root>/relationships/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` symlinked or copied to `today.md`.

### `<config-root>/relationships/today.json`

Structured JSON for downstream consumers (future web app, Operator desktop, daily-brief render layer).

JSON schema documented in `references/today-json-schema.md` (TBD Phase 2). Minimum fields:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "budget_minutes": 30,
  "buckets": [
    {
      "id": "new_biz",
      "label": "New Business Development",
      "options": [
        {
          "rank": 1,
          "person": { "slug": "sarah-chen", "name": "Sarah Chen", "title": "...", "company": "..." },
          "why_now": "...",
          "channel": "linkedin_dm_cold",
          "time_estimate_min": 5,
          "draft_subject": "...",
          "draft_body": "...",
          "template_used": "dm/linkedin-cold-icp.md",
          "score": 0.78,
          "tier": "operational",
          "icp_fit": "primary"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "carrying": { "operational_overdue": 23, "strategic_cooling": 4 }
}
```

---

## Step 7 — Person-page side effects (opt-in)

If the user marks a card as "done" (in conversation: "I sent that to Sarah" / "done with #1"), append to that person's cortex page **## Recent interactions** log:

```
<today> — <channel> — relationships brief touch (<bucket>)
```

Update **Last meaningful contact** in Relationship section if appropriate.

If cortex isn't installed (`<config-root>/memory/` missing), skip silently.

**Never** modify Identity, Notes, or other sections. Always additive.

---

## Step 8 — Log to memory/log.md (cortex log-writer)

If cortex `log-writer` skill is available, append:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] /relationships | brief produced — N actions across 3 buckets, X min budget
```

Otherwise skip.

---

## Behavior rules

- **Drafts only.** Never send a message, never create a CRM task without explicit confirmation, never add a calendar event without confirmation.
- **No guilt.** If the user runs the brief and carries a 40-deep backlog, the brief surfaces the top 3 and quietly notes the rest. No nagging.
- **One-tap actions.** Every card should have a copy-ready draft, a recommended channel, and a time estimate. The user should be able to do the action in under the estimated time without further thinking.
- **Voice-faithful.** Pull from the named voice for the surface. Honor banned-phrases lists (cortex + plugin).
- **Honest about gaps.** If a draft has a missing variable, say so. If pipeline-analyst returns Low confidence, surface it. If a contact has thin cortex data, mark the card as "research-thin — verify before sending."
- **Idempotent within a day.** Running `/relationships` twice in a day re-reads sources and re-ranks; today.md/today.json get overwritten. The user's marked-done actions persist in cortex person pages.
- **Respect the autonomy slider.** In `auto` mode, skip the time-budget prompt (use default) and skip per-card confirmations. In `confirm` mode, walk every card individually.
