description: Configure the relationships plugin. Auto-imports identity, voice, ICP, CRM, Apollo, cooling rules, and banned phrases from peer plugin configs when they exist — so for full-stack Nucleus users this collapses to ~3 confirmations. For standalone installs (no peers), runs the full interview. Writes results to <config-root>/plugins/relationships.user-context.md. Re-run anytime to update.
---

# /setup-relationships

Configure the plugin. The interview length depends on what's already in your `<config-root>/`:

- **Full Nucleus stack** (cortex + lead-engine + core-ops + referral-engine installed): ~60 seconds. Pre-filled from peers; you confirm and answer the few relationships-unique questions.
- **Standalone install**: ~5–10 minutes. Full interview.

Idempotent — re-running updates rather than restarts.

## Step 0 — Resolve plugin config root

Per-plugin config in this marketplace lives under a user-chosen folder, recorded at `~/Documents/.claude-plugin-config-root` (single-line text file in the user's home).

### A — Try the pointer

Ensure access to `~/Documents`. In Cowork, call `request_cowork_directory(~/Documents)` once if not already granted. In Claude Code (or any environment with direct filesystem access), no mount is needed. Then read `~/Documents/.claude-plugin-config-root`.

- **Exists:** read line 1 → that's the config root path. Ensure access to `<config-root>`. If running in Cowork and the folder isn't already mounted in this session, call `request_cowork_directory(<config-root>)`. If running in Claude Code or another environment with direct filesystem access, no mount call is needed. Skip to section C.
- **Missing:** continue to section B.

### B — First-time bootstrap

Prompt: "First-time plugin setup. Where should I store your plugin config — identity, voice, and per-plugin settings? Pick a folder you control (e.g., `~/Documents/Claude/` or `~/Documents/PluginConfig/`). The folder will hold `identity.md`, `voice.md`, and a `plugins/` subdirectory."

Then:
1. Ensure access to `<path>`. If running in Cowork and the folder isn't already mounted, call `request_cowork_directory(<path>)`. In Claude Code, no mount call needed.
2. Create `<path>/plugins/`. Write absolute path to `~/Documents/.claude-plugin-config-root`.

### C — Note resolved root

For the rest of this document, **`<config-root>`** refers to the resolved path. This plugin's config file lives at **`<config-root>/plugins/relationships.user-context.md`**.

---

## Step 0.5 — Peer-plugin import (the heavy lifting)

Before asking the user anything, scan for peer-plugin configs and pre-fill what's there. **Read-only one-time import** — once values land in `relationships.user-context.md`, this plugin does not re-read peer files at runtime. (Re-running setup re-imports.)

Build an internal "detected" dictionary. For each source, read defensively — if a section is missing or renamed, log a `Notes:` entry and skip silently. Do not fabricate values.

### Identity

Source: `<config-root>/identity.md` (cortex `/setup-identity`).
Extract:
- Name → `identity.name`
- Company → `identity.company`
- One-sentence description (look for "what we do" / "positioning" / "we do" patterns) → `identity.one_liner`

Fallback: extract from `<config-root>/plugins/bizdev-outreach.user-context.md` `## Company` section if present (legacy migration path).

### Voice — primary

Source: `<config-root>/voice.md` (cortex `/setup-voice`) and `<config-root>/plugins/writing-style.user-context.md` if installed.
Extract:
- Three-word descriptors (e.g., "calibrated, practitioner, honest")
- Sign-off style
- Banned phrases (the cortex defaults are well-known; capture user-added ones)

### Voice — additional named voices (legacy)

Source: `<config-root>/plugins/bizdev-outreach.user-context.md` `## Banned phrases (custom)` and `## Casual email register`.

If the legacy bizdev-outreach file has voice-specific overrides (banned phrases, casual register), capture as a `business` voice block in addition to the primary voice. Note: the user can rename or split this in the confirmation step.

### ICP (primary + secondary + out-of-ICP)

Source priority order:
1. `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.user-context.md` `## ICP` section — most detailed (titles, org types, sizes, regions, maturity, problem framing).
2. `<config-root>/plugins/weekly-outreach.user-context.md` `## ICP` section.
3. `<config-root>/plugins/bizdev-outreach.user-context.md` `## Company / Target market` block.

Take the most detailed available source. If multiple disagree, keep lead-engine's and flag the discrepancy in the confirmation step.

### Current quarter focus + outcome target

Source priority order:
1. `<config-root>/memory/workstream/*.md` — scan for active workstream nodes whose status indicates current-quarter priority. Cortex workstream nodes are the canonical place for this; if one named "q3-outbound" or similar is active, capture its focus.
2. `<config-root>/user.md` — check for any `## Quarterly focus` or `## Quarter target` sections.

If neither yields a result, ask in the confirmation step.

### CRM properties

Source: `<config-root>/plugins/core-ops.user-context.md` (preferred) or `<config-root>/plugins/weekly-outreach.user-context.md` `## CRM` section (legacy).
Extract:
- Tool (HubSpot / Salesforce / Pipedrive / Attio)
- Owner ID
- Pipeline stages
- Custom property names (cadence_property, icp_fit_property, do_not_engage_property)
- API tier notes if present (e.g., "Starter — no Sequences API")

### Apollo + signal preferences

Source: `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.user-context.md` (preferred) or `<config-root>/plugins/weekly-outreach.user-context.md` `## Apollo` section (legacy).
Extract:
- Enabled? (Y/N)
- Daily DM budget, weekly net-new cap
- Signal priorities (job changes, funding, posts)

### Referral cooling + connector taxonomy

Source: `<config-root>/plugins/referral-engine.user-context.md`.
Extract:
- Connector taxonomy (relationship_type values that count as connector, lists, tags)
- Quiet threshold (default 60 days)
- Trigger patterns (positive moments, fiscal-year, seasonal, conference proximity)
- Ask cadence cap (default 180 days)

### Companion plugin detection

Runtime-detect, do not ask:
- `cortex`: `<config-root>/memory/` directory exists
- `lead-engine`: `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.user-context.md` exists
- `core-ops`: `<config-root>/plugins/core-ops.user-context.md` exists
- `referral-engine`: `<config-root>/plugins/referral-engine.user-context.md` exists
- `daily-brief`: `<config-root>/plugins/daily-brief.user-context.md` exists
- `writing-style`: `<config-root>/plugins/writing-style.user-context.md` exists

Mark each as installed/not. Used to decide whether to delegate to subagents like `contact-researcher` and `pipeline-analyst`.

---

## Step 1 — Check for existing relationships config

Read `<config-root>/plugins/relationships.user-context.md`.

- **Populated:** ask whether to (a) merge peer-import updates into existing file, (b) update specific sections only, (c) start over. Default: (a) merge — least destructive.
- **Missing:** start fresh from the peer-import dictionary.

---

## Step 2 — Confirmation interview

For full-stack Nucleus users, this is mostly "here's what I detected, confirm or correct." For standalone users, this is the full interview.

Present the detected dictionary as a summary first:

```
Detected from your existing config:
  Identity:           [name] · [company] · [one-liner]
  Primary voice:      [three words] · [sign-off]
  Primary ICP:        [titles] @ [org types], [sizes]
  Secondary ICP:      [...]
  CRM:                [tool] · [N custom properties]
  Apollo:             [enabled? · caps]
  Cooling rules:      [quiet threshold] · [ask cadence cap]
  Companions:         cortex ✓ · lead-engine ✓ · core-ops ✓ · referral-engine ✓ · ...

Look right? (y / fix / replay specific section)
```

If the user says "fix" or names a section, walk that section in detail. Otherwise accept the detected values and move on.

### Then ask the relationships-unique questions (these are NOT in any peer file)

One at a time, confirm before moving on. **Surface the default; ask only if user wants to override.**

**Q1 — Close personal track?**
- Most operators run business-only. Do you want a separate `Close personal` track in the daily brief? (family + closest friends, surfaced on its own tab so personal doesn't compete with biz)
- Default: **No**.
- If yes: how many people, what cadence (default 30 days).

**Q2 — Tier sizes (override defaults?)**
- Defaults: Inner Core 10–15 (biweekly cadence) · Strategic 30–50 (monthly) · Operational 100–200 (quarterly) · Dormant rest (trigger-only).
- Surface them, ask: any tier you want to override?
- If yes: which tier, what size, what cadence.

**Q3 — Time budget**
- Most operators run with a consistent daily window. What's your typical availability for relationship work? (5 / 15 / 30 / 60+ min — pick the most common)
- Default: **30 minutes**.
- Variable? If yes: enable the time-budget prompt at the top of every `/relationships` invocation.

**Q4 — Network expansion voices**
- The daily brief's network-expansion bucket suggests content posting prompts. Do you have multiple LinkedIn voices (e.g., personal brand + business page)?
- Default: **One voice** (primary).
- If multiple: name each voice and what surface it posts to.

**Q5 — Bucket emphasis (advanced; default equal)**
- Default: equal weight across new-biz / relationship / network-expansion buckets.
- Want to override? (e.g., prospecting-heavy = 1.5 new-biz, 0.8 others)
- Most users say no. Skip unless they bring it up.

That's it. For a full-stack user with peer files populated, you've asked 4 questions. For a standalone install, expand each peer-imported field into the full interview from the original v0.1.0 setup.

---

## Step 3 — Write the config

Populate `<config-root>/plugins/relationships.user-context.md`. See `references/user-context.template.md` for the slim canonical layout.

The written file ONLY contains:
- Identity (minimal — primary key for templates: name, first_name, company, one_liner)
- Relationships preferences (tiers, buckets, close-personal, time budget, voices for network expansion, scoring overrides if any)
- Companion-plugin detection results (so /relationships knows what to delegate to)
- Provenance notes (which fields came from which peer file)

Identity, voice, ICP, CRM, Apollo, cooling rules are NOT written here — `/relationships` reads them live from their canonical peer files at runtime. This avoids duplication and keeps the truth in one place per concern.

**Exception:** if a peer file is missing (standalone install), capture the equivalent fields in `relationships.user-context.md` under `## Standalone fallback` sections. The plugin can run without peers; it just stores its own copy.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm and offer next step

Summarize what was written.

Offer:
> "Run `/network-rebalance` once to tag your existing cortex person pages with tier + bucket frontmatter. Then `/relationships` daily."

---

## Behavior rules

- **Peer-import is one-time at setup.** Re-running setup re-imports.
- **Read defensively.** If a peer file has a renamed section, log it in the confirmation step as `Notes:` — don't crash.
- **Confirm, don't interrogate.** For full-stack users, defaults + detected values + a handful of confirmations is the whole experience.
- **Standalone-install fallback.** If no peers exist, expand each peer-imported step into a full interview question. The plugin must work for a stranger who only installed `relationships` + cortex.
- **Respect the autonomy slider** (`<config-root>/plugins/cortex.user-context.md` → `autonomy:`). In `auto` mode, accept detected values and defaults; only ask for sections without sensible defaults.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running merges with existing config; doesn't blow it away unless user explicitly says "start over."
