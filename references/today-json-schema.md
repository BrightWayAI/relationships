# `today.json` schema

The structured artifact produced by `/relationships` after each daily brief run. Written to `<config-root>/relationships/today.json` (and a date-stamped copy at `<config-root>/relationships/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`).

This is the **stable contract** that downstream surfaces depend on — a future Next.js web app, the Operator desktop app, daily-brief tight-coupling, and any third-party reader. Treat it like a public API.

## Versioning

The JSON includes a `schema_version` field at the root. Backward-incompatible changes bump the major version; additive (new optional fields) bumps minor.

Current schema version: **`0.1.0`**.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "date": "2026-05-28",
  "brief_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-28T07:30:00-04:00",
  "user": {
    "name": "Zach Wagner",
    "first_name": "Zach",
    "company": "BrightWay AI",
    "one_liner": "AI-powered pre-production infrastructure for educational video at scale"
  },
  "budget_minutes": 30,
  "budget_mode": "default | variable | override",
  "quarter_focus": "Studio K-12 anchors",
  "quarter_target": "2 Phase-1 anchors signed",
  "buckets": [
    { /* see Bucket shape */ }
  ],
  "carrying": {
    "operational_overdue": 23,
    "strategic_cooling": 4,
    "inner_overdue_not_surfaced": 0,
    "personal_overdue_not_surfaced": 2
  },
  "best_fits_for_budget": [
    {
      "bucket_id": "relationship",
      "option_rank": 1,
      "time_estimate_min": 5
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Pipeline analyst returned Medium confidence — CRM data partial."
  ]
}
```

## Bucket shape

```json
{
  "id": "new_biz | relationship | network",
  "label": "New Business Development",
  "weight": 1.0,
  "options": [
    { /* see Option shape */ }
  ],
  "sub_tabs": [
    { "id": "business", "label": "Business" },
    { "id": "personal", "label": "Close Personal" }
  ],
  "empty_state_note": null
}
```

`sub_tabs` is present only on the `relationship` bucket when the user has enabled the close-personal track. Options inside sub-tabs carry a `sub_tab` field tying them to one. Other buckets omit `sub_tabs`.

`empty_state_note` is present (non-null) when the bucket has fewer than 3 options — explains why ("no urgent actions; quietly carrying X overdue Operational contacts").

## Option shape

**Stable option ID format:** `<bucket>_<person-slug>_<YYYY-MM-DD>` — bucket + slug + date. Same person on the same day → same ID across re-runs, so a UI can correlate "did I act on Sarah's card?" reliably across page reloads.

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "id": "new_biz_sarah-chen_2026-05-28",

    "source": "websearch | crm | gmail | cortex | manual",
    "observed_at": "2026-05-22"

    "next_steps_if_done": [
      "Append to cortex person page Recent interactions",
      "Update next_touch_target"
    ],
    "snooze_options_days": [1, 3, 7, 30]
  }
}
```

### Channel enum

```
linkedin_dm_cold
linkedin_dm_warm
linkedin_dm_followup
linkedin_dm_congrats
linkedin_comment
instagram_dm
email_cold
email_warm
email_followup
email_intro_request
email_recap
text_checkin
text_congrats
phone_call_warm
phone_call_discovery
conference_dm_pre
conference_dm_post
self_post
```

The channel maps directly to a template family in `references/templates/`. If a future surface (e.g., web app) renders cards, the channel determines the icon, the channel label, and the typical action (copy + open the right app).

## JSON Schema (draft)

A formal JSON Schema document for validation is shipped alongside this doc at `references/today-json-schema.json` (TBD — to be generated when the writer is implemented). The high-level shape from this doc is authoritative until then.

## Reader expectations

Surfaces consuming this artifact should:

1. **Check `schema_version`.** If it's a major version they don't know, render a "schema mismatch" warning and refuse to act on actions (`actions.copy_payload` is still safe to render, but `actions.next_steps_if_done` may have changed semantics).
2. **Use `draft.needs_user_touch`** to flag incomplete drafts visually (e.g., yellow border on the card).
3. **Honor `confidence`** — Low confidence cards should display a "research-thin" indicator.
4. **Use `actions.copy_payload`** as the canonical thing to copy on tap. Never copy `draft.body` directly — `copy_payload` includes any subject + body assembly.
5. **Use `carrying`** to render a "quietly carrying X overdue" footnote so the user knows nothing was lost.

## Privacy

The artifact contains personally identifying information (full names, companies, sometimes phone-tier indicators). Treat as confidential. The plugin gitignores `<config-root>/relationships/` against accidental commit; downstream consumers should not log or transmit the artifact without user consent.

## Related files (the full plugin contract surface)

`today.json` is one of four files a UI consumer interacts with. See `references/ui-integration.md` for the complete contract:

- **`<config-root>/relationships/today.json`** — this file. Overwritten on every `/relationships` run.
- **`<config-root>/relationships/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`** — date-stamped historical snapshots.
- **`<config-root>/relationships/events.jsonl`** — append-only event log. UI reads for analytics. Events written by `/relationships-action`.
- **`<config-root>/relationships/snoozes.json`** — persistent snooze state. Read by `/relationships` Step 3; written by `/relationships-action`.
- **`<config-root>/relationships/inbox/`** — UI drops JSON events here; sync daemon invokes `/relationships-action --file=<path>`.
