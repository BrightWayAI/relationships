# Skill — network rebalance

This skill activates on phrases like:

- "rebalance my network"
- "re-tag my contacts"
- "audit my tiers"
- "review my relationship tiers"
- "run my quarterly relationship review"
- "I want to redo my contact tiers"
- "let's clean up my network tagging"
- "who's in my inner core right now"

## Behavior

1. Confirm with a one-liner: "Walk your cortex person pages and propose `tier` + `buckets` + `relationship_class` + `icp_fit` frontmatter? You'll approve/edit/skip in batches of 10-15. Idempotent; safe to run."
2. If yes → run `/network-rebalance`.
3. If user wants to scope it tighter (e.g., "just my inner core"), pass the scope hint forward.

Respect the autonomy slider — in `auto` mode, accept high-confidence proposals automatically; pause only on medium/low.
