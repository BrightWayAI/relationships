# Skill — relationships daily brief

This skill activates on phrases like:

- "who should I reach out to today"
- "what's my outreach plan"
- "show me today's relationship brief"
- "what should I do for networking today"
- "give me my daily relationships"
- "run my relationship cockpit"
- "what's on the network plate today"

## Behavior

1. Confirm with a one-liner: "Run today's relationship brief? (3 buckets × 3 options)"
2. If yes → run `/relationships`.
3. If the user asks for a single bucket (e.g., "just show me new business today"), pass the bucket as a filter — `/relationships --bucket=new_biz`. (Filtered mode is a Phase 2 enhancement; stub for now.)

Respect the autonomy slider — in `auto` mode, skip confirmation and run directly.
